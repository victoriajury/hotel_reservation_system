## Steps for creating the initial Flask application

### Install Flask
```
$ pipenv install Flask
```
#### Developing a hotel reservation application

The application builds upon steps from tutorial https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/tutorial/


## Run the application

### Initialise database
```
$ flask --app reservation_system init-db
$ flask --app reservation_system dummy-data
```
### Run app with debugger
```
$ flask --app reservation_system run --debug
```
###
If flask runs successfully, you should be able to click the link in terminal:

```
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

Log in to the system as username 'admin' with password 'dev'.


### Run the tests

#### Coverage with Pytest
```
$ coverage run -m pytest
```
#### View report in terminal
```
$ coverage report
```
#### Generate reports

This then works with Coverage Gutters VS Code extension to view coverage in module's python files.
```
$ coverage xml
```
